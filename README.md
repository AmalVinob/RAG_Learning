# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Learning Project

This project is a hands-on exploration of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — a powerful technique that combines external document retrieval with language generation to produce more informed and context-aware outputs.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

- Fundamentals of **RAG architecture**
- How to chunk and preprocess documents for retrieval
- Indexing documents using **FAISS vector database**
- Combining **BM25** and **FAISS** for hybrid retrieval
- Using **Cohere** to generate responses grounded in retrieved context

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **LangChain** – to handle chaining logic and retrievers
- **FAISS** – for dense vector-based retrieval
- **BM25** – for sparse keyword-based retrieval
- **Cohere API** – for generating answers based on the retrieved context
- **HuggingFace Transformers** – for embedding models
- **Wikipedia** – used for sample document content
